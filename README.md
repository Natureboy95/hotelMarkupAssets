Recreated a prototype on HTML
Peer Review by: Avery Hillstrom - comments: Good effort! I would recommend going over the different types of HTML and CSS elements again, but there seems to be a good basic understanding of html and its structure. The website is missing amenities, a reservation section, and a footer. The navbar needs to be centered, and the test in the middle of the header needs to be adjusted to be lower in the div. Although it is missing things and not optimized for mobile or tablet, what aspects of the site are there are executed in a simple and organized way. Keep up the good work, it's getting close to the mock-up! Time reviewed: 4:34PM 11.03.2023
